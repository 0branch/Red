Red Programming Language
------------------------

Red is a new programming langage strongly inspired by REBOL (http://rebol.com), but with a broader field of usage, from system programming to high-level scripting, and providing a modern support for concurrency and multicore CPU.

The langage is in its early bootstrapping phase. The Red/System low-level DSL is the first focus. It's a limited C-level langage with a REBOL look'n feel, required to build Red's runtime library.

Running the Hello script
------------------------
The compiler and linker are currently written in REBOL and produce PE executable (Windows) but it will be soon extended to support ELF too. So, for now, a REBOL/View Windows binary is required to run it. Follow the instructions :

1) Download a REBOL interpreter from here: http://www.rebol.com/downloads/v278/rebol-view-278-3-1.exe 

2) Save it in red-system/ folder and run it, you'll see a >> prompt appear

3) Type: do/args %rsc.r "%tests/hello.reds"

4) The resulting binary is in red-system/builds/hello.exe, open a DOS console and run it.


The %rsc.r script is only a wrapper script around the compiler, for testing purpose. It accepts a -v[vvv] option for verbose logs. Try it with:

do/args %rsc.r "-vvvv %tests/hello.reds"
